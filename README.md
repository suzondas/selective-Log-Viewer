# selective-Log-Viewer
This feature adds facility in Koha for viewing the Patrons Log in selective manner. Primarially it is developed for showing Catalog Add (biblio, item) option with date specification or without date range. This helps to find out the log information using name of the patron. This also helps to count the total book entry done by patrons(s) and also to count wages.
